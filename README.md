 ## Redux To Do 
 > Task : Create a React To Do app using redux for state management
 ### Tools
 - Zip React rewrite 
 - React Redux Docs : https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start

 ### Notes
 - styling seems clunky : could probably combine some stuff
 - added google icons for no reason but so cute!
 - naming could be better :)

 ### Working Sessions
 - 03/18 : how tf do I make this work for a simple todo app
 - 03/19 : (actually read the docs lol) app set up + crud functionality 
 - 03/20 : styling <3 + clean up
